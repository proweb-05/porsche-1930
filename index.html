            <p>Porsche is a German automotive company founded in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche, an engineer who had
                previously worked on designing cars such as the Volkswagen Beetle. <br>
                Today, Porsche is one of the most renowned and respected manufacturers of premium-class vehicles,
                specializing in sports cars, SUVs, and sedans, combining high performance, luxury, and innovative
                technologies in its models. <br>
                The company's most iconic model is the Porsche 911, introduced in 1964. <br>
                This car, with its rear-engine layout and unique design, quickly gained popularity and has since
                maintained its status, becoming a true icon of the automotive world. The development of the 911 was so
                successful that it set the brand's overall style and remains the foundation of Porsche to this day. <br>
                Porsche has always been known for its technological achievements. The company’s engineers were among the
                first to use lightweight carbon materials, improve aerodynamics, and refine suspension systems,
                achieving exceptional handling and stability at high speeds. Porsche is also famous for its success in
                motorsport, where its models regularly place highly, including in prestigious races such as the 24 Hours
                of Le Mans.</p>
